===============================
As of Spring Framework 5, alongside the WebFlux stack, Spring introduced a new HTTP client called WebClient.

WebClient is a modern, alternative HTTP client to RestTemplate. Not only does it provide a traditional synchronous API, but it also supports an efficient nonblocking and asynchronous approach.

That said, if we're developing new applications or migrating an old one, it's a good idea to use WebClient. Moving forward, RestTemplate will be deprecated in future versions.
