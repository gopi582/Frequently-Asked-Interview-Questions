1. Download the wire mock standalone jar from this link (http://wiremock.org/docs/running-standalone/).
2. Add this gradle dependency (testImplementation 'com.github.tomakehurst:wiremock-jre8-standalone:2.29.1') in build.gradle file.
3. Run this command from git bash ot command prompt java -jar wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.29.1.jar

Run the below url's.

1. To know the current mappings (http://localhost:8080/__admin/mappings)
2. TO get the swagger API and Swagger Docs (http://localhost:8080/__admin/docs)
3. TO record live application request and response json (http://localhost:8080/__admin/recorder/)

Best Example to write the integration test cases by using wiremock utilization:
================================================================================
I have To Micro Services

1. login-service (8082)
2. reg-service (8081)

In my case in login-service consuming data from reg-service by using the Web Client. To write the integration test case for this scenario added the below steps,

	Wire Mock Server (8080)

1. I have recorded the reg-service request and response by uisng wire mock recorder.
2. Pasted the Generated json files under src/test/resources/mapping folder.
3. While invoking the reg-service endpoints from login-service added wiremock port 8080 in login-application instead of reg-service port 8081.

Imp:
=========
1. If we are validating the integration test cases in localhost for above applications we need to run the wiremock server in local with command java -jar wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.29.1.jar

2. In PCF we need to copy the recorded json files in PCF and need to run wire mock in PCF seperately.


Steps to record the request and response from postman.
=========================================================
Example: 
i)I have a login application that was running on port 8082. for fetching the customer details i am using below url. It is using post method,

http://localhost:8082/login/v1/finByUserId

ii) My wiremock server runnign on 8080 port.

1. Hit this url (http://localhost:8080/__admin/recorder/)
2. In the record screen give the micro service endpoint (http://localhost:8082)
3. In the post man we need to hit the microservice with wiremock server url (http://localhost:8080/login/v1/finByUserId).
